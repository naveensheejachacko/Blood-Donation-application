# Blood Donation Directory — User Guide

A short guide for using the Blood Donation Directory website.

---

## For Everyone (Public)

**Website address:**  
Use the main link you received (e.g. `https://blood-donation-application-23lp.vercel.app`).

- You can **browse blood donors** by blood group and district.
- Use the **Blood group** and **District** dropdowns to filter, and **Reset filters** to clear.
- Each card shows: photo, name, blood group, district, weight (if available), and last donation date.
- **Click a donor’s photo** to view it enlarged; click outside or the × to close.
- No login is required to view the directory.

## For Administrators

### First-time setup

1. Open the **Admin** link (see “Important links” below). You will see **Sign in** and **Register** on the same page.
2. **New user:** Use the **Register** section — enter your **email** and **password**, then submit. A **super admin** must add you as an admin in the system. After that, you can sign in.
3. **Existing user:** Use the **Sign in** section — enter your **email** and **password**. You will be taken to the **Admin portal**, where you can manage donors.

### In the Admin portal

After login you will see:

- **Add / Edit donor** — Add a new donor or edit an existing one (name, blood group, district, phone, weight, photo, last donation date). You can upload a photo from your device.
- **All donors** — Search and filter the full list. Use **Edit** to change a donor or **Delete** to remove them.
- **Logout** — Use the Logout button at the top to sign out.

**Note:** Only a **super admin** can see and use the **Manage admins** option.

---

## For Super Administrators

- Everything that admins can do, plus:
- **Manage admins** — View all admins, block or unblock them, and make someone a super admin or regular admin.
- You cannot block yourself or remove your own super admin status.

## Important links

Replace `YOUR-WEBSITE-URL` with your actual website address (e.g. `https://blood-donation-application-23lp.vercel.app`).

| Purpose           | Link |
|-------------------|------|
| Public directory  | `YOUR-WEBSITE-URL` |
| Admin (sign in & register) | `YOUR-WEBSITE-URL/#/blood-kochi-login` |
| Admin portal      | `YOUR-WEBSITE-URL/#/admin` (after login) |

**Example (Vercel):**

- Public: `https://blood-donation-application-23lp.vercel.app`
- Admin (sign in or register): `https://blood-donation-application-23lp.vercel.app/#/blood-kochi-login`

Both sign in and register are on the same page. Keep this admin link private and share it only with people who should have admin access.
